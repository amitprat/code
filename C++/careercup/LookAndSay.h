Implement LookAndSay function. For example, first, let user input a number, say 1. Then, the function will generate the next 10 numbers which satisfy this condition:
1, 11,21,1211,111221,312211...
explanation: first number 1, second number is one 1, so 11. Third number is two 1(previous number), so 21. next number one 2 one 1, so 1211 and so on...
